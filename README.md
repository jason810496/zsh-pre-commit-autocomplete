    <p> Enhancing your <a href="https://pre-commit.com/ ">pre-commit</a> experience with seamless hook autocompletionðŸŽ¢ </p>
</div>

****

> Since `pre-commit` does not support autocompletion ([reference](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1119)), and the [`oh-my-zsh` pre-commit plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/pre-commit) only provides aliases for common commands. <br>
> This plugin enhances usability by offering autocompletion for the `run` command, listing all available hooks.

## Features

- Autocompletion for the `pre-commit run` command.
- Lists all hooks available in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

## Usage

> This demo uses Apache Airflow as an example.
